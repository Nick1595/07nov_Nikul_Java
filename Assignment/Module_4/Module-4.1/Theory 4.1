OOP ->  OOP means object oriented programming ,oop is a programming paradigm based on the concept of the object  
        in which data and code contains.The data is in the form of field and the code is in the form of procedure.

There are mainly 4 primary concept of OOP -> 1-Abstraction,2-Encaplusation,3-Inhertance,4-Polymorphism

(1)Abstraction. Using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t 
                need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects,
                classes and variables represent more complex underlying code and data.

(2)Encapsulation. The practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields 
via public methods. Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.

(3)Inheritance. A special feature of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, Inheritance lets programmers create new classes
that share some of the attributes of existing classes. 

(4)Polymorphism. Allows programmers to use the same word in Java to mean different things in different contexts.
One form of polymorphism is method overloading. That’s when the code itself implies different meanings. The other form is method overriding.

Difference Between OOP AND POP -->
                                                    |
                      OOP                           |                      POP
                                                    |
   1- IT follows bottom to Top approch.             | 1- It follows Top to Bottom Approch.
                                                    |
   2- It have access specifier like pubblic,private | 2- There is no any access specifier.
                                                    |
   3- For eg   c++,java                             | 3- For eg C Fortran
                                                    |
   4 - Object oriented.                             | 4- Structure oriented.
                                                    |
                                                    |
   5 - Program is divided into objects.	            | 5- Program is divided into functions.
                                                    |  
   6 - Bottom-up approach.	                        | 6- Top-down approach.
                                                    |
   7 - Inheritance property is used.	              | 7- Inheritance is not allowed.
                                                    | 
   8 - It uses access specifier.	                  | 8- It doesn’t use access specifier.
                                                    | 
   9 - Encapsulation is used to hide the data.	    | 9- No data hiding.
                                                    |
   10- Concept of virtual function .                | 10-No virtual function.
                                                    |
