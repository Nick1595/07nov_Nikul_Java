->  Software is a collection of Data , Instruction , and information .
->  It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. 


                                                       * What is Software engineering ?

-> Software engineering is defined as a process of analyzing user requirements and then designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy those requirements.


                                                      Q-2.* Types of software 

-> There is mainly three types of software 
  . Application Software 
  . Programming software 
  . System software 

---> Appliation software     
. application software is a computer 
software package that performs a specific function for a user, or in some 
cases, for another application


--> programming software
. Programming software and programming tools enable developers to 
develop, write, test and debug other software programs is known as programming software

--> System Software
. To run a computer's application  programs and hardware system software are disigned .
 
                                                   Q-3. What is SDLC And Explain each prases 

--> SDLC stands for Software Devlopment Life Cycle 
--> SDLC refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.

--> Phases of SDLC  .
       1. Planning.
       2. Analysis.
       3. Designing.
       4. Implementation.
       5. Testing.
       6. Maintenance.
       
  --->> planning       -  1. Identification of the system for development.
                          2. Feasibility assessment.
                          3.Creation of project plan.
       
       
  --->> Amalysis       -  1. Gathering business requirement.
                          2. Creating process diagrams.
                          3. Performing a detailed analysis.
                          
  --->> Designing      -  1. Designing the IT infrastructure.
                          2. Designing the system model.

  --->> Implementation -  1. Development of IT infrastructure.
                          2. Development of database and code.
                          
  --->> Testing        -  1. Writing test cases.
                          2. Execution of test cases.                   
                          
  --->> Maintenance    -  1. Support the system users
                          2. System maintenance
                          3. System changes and adjustment                    

                                                     Q-4. What is DFD
                                                     
  --> DFD means Data flow diagram 
  --.A data flow diagram maps out the flow of information for any process or system. It uses 
  defined symbols like rectangles, circles and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, 
  outputs, storage points and the routes between each destination.
